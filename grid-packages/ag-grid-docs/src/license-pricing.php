                            Allows licensed developers to sub-license AG Grid for one application on one production
                            environment in perpetuity. Includes a 1-year subscription to new versions, support and
                            maintenance. Only available with a Developer License.

                                A Deployment License Add-on allows making a project available
                                to individuals (eg your customers) outside of your organisation
                                (sub-license).

                                One Deployment License Add-on covers one production environment
                                for one project.

                                Only production environments require licensing. All other environments
                                (eg development, test, pre-production) do not require a license.

                                We do not charge per server. A cluster of many servers
                                part of one application installation is considered one deployment
                                and requires one Deployment License. This is true so long as the
                                application instances within the cluster are replicas of each other
                                and server to provide load balancing and fail over only.

                                Production failover deployments do not need to be licensed separately.
                                They are considered part of the overall application production deployment.

                                Multi-tenant deployments, where one application instance is serving
                                many customers over different URLs, is considered one deployment, as
                                each tenant is getting serviced by the same application instance.

                                independent deployments and need a Deployment License for each
                                individual application instance.

                                Deploying an application to a cloud service (eg AWS or Docker) requires
                                one Deployment License, regardless of how many virtual containers
                                or servers the cloud application spawns for that one single instance
                                of the application.

                            If you have a deployment that doesn't fit within our licensing model,

                            A software project will have an indirect dependency on AG Grid Enterprise even if it's wrapped into
                            another framework, file, library, etc. Every Front-End JavaScript developer working on a project using
                            a library that wraps AG Grid Enterprise will need to be licensed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Please note: You are not allowed to wrap AG Grid Enterprise in a framework, library, component, etc. and
                            make it available as a development tool outside of your organisation.
