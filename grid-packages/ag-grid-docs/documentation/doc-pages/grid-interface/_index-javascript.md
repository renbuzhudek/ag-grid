| ## Grid Options
|
| The `gridOptions` object is a 'one stop shop' for the entire interface into the grid. 
|
| The example below shows the different types of items available on `gridOptions`.
|
| ```js
| var gridOptions = {
|     // PROPERTIES
|     // Objects like myRowData and myColDefs would be created in your application
|     rowData: myRowData,
|     columnDefs: myColDefs,
|     pagination: true,
|     rowSelection: 'single',
|
|     // EVENTS
|     // Add event handlers
|     onRowClicked: event => console.log('A row was clicked'),
|     onColumnResized: event => console.log('A column was resized'),
|     onGridReady: event => console.log('The grid is now ready'),
|
|     // CALLBACKS
|     isScrollLag: () => false
| }
| ```
|
| Once the grid is initialised, you will also have access to the grid API (`api`) and column API (`columnApi`) on the `gridOptions` object as shown:
|
| ```js
| // refresh the grid
| gridOptions.api.refreshView();
|
| // resize columns in the grid to fit the available space
| gridOptions.columnApi.sizeColumnsToFit();
| ```
|
| ### Grid API
|
| The Grid API (both `api` and `columnApi`) will only be available after the `gridReady` event has been fired.
|
| You can access the APIs in the following ways:
|
| - Store them from the `gridReady` event - they'll be available via the `params` argument passed into the event
| - Provide a `gridOptions` object to the grid pre-creation time. Post-creation the APIs will be available on the `gridOptions` object.
|
| ## Listening to Events
|
| In addition to adding event listeners directly via the `gridOptions` object, it is possible to register for events, similar to registering for events on native DOM elements. This means there are two ways to listen for events: either to use the `onXXX()` method on the API (where XXX is replaced with the event name), or to register for the event. The latter option allows you to add multiple handlers  for the same event. The following example demonstrates the two options:
|
| ```js
| // create handler function
| function myRowClickedHandler(event) {
|     console.log('The row was clicked');
| }
|
| // option 1: use the API
| gridOptions.onRowClicked = myRowClickedHandler;
|
| // option 2: register the handler
| gridOptions.api.addEventListener('rowClicked', myRowClickedHandler);
| ```
