The Set Filter takes inspiration from Excel's AutoFilter and allows filtering on sets of data. It is built on top of the shared functionality that is common across all [Provided Filters](/filter-provided/).

## Set Filter Sections

The Set Filter is comprised of the following sections:

- **[Mini Filter](/filter-set-mini-filter/)**: used to narrow the values available for selection inside the Filter List.
- **Select All**: used to select / deselect all values shown in the Filter List.
- **[Filter List](/filter-set-filter-list/)**: a list of Set Filter Values which can be selected / deselected to set the filter.
- **Filter Buttons**: Action buttons that can be optionally added to the bottom of the Set Filter.

## Enabling Set Filters

The Set Filter is the default filter used in AG Grid Enterprise, but it can also be explicitly configured as shown below:

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        // Set Filter is used by default in Enterprise version
        { field: 'country', filter: true },
        // explicitly configure column to use the Set Filter
        { field: 'year', filter: 'agSetColumnFilter' },
    ],
}
</snippet>

The following example demonstrates how the Set Filter can be enabled. Note the following:

- The **Athlete** column has `filter=true` which defaults to the Set Filter as this example is using AG Grid Enterprise.
- The **Country** column is explicitly configured to use the Set Filter using `filter='agSetColumnFilter'`.
- All other columns are configured to use the [Number Filter](/filter-number/) using `filter='agNumberColumnFilter'`.
- Filters can be accessed from the [Column Menu](/column-menu/) or by clicking on the filter icon in the [Floating Filters](/floating-filters/).
