|## Registering Custom Components
|
|The pages for each component type (cell renderer, cell editor etc) contain examples on how to register and use each component type.
|It is however useful here to step back and focus on the component registration process which is common across all component types.
|
|There are two ways to register custom components:
|
|- By name.
|- Direct reference.
|
|Both options are fully supported by the grid, however registering by name is AG Grid's preferred option as it's more flexible.
|All of the examples in the documentation use this approach.
|The direct reference approach is kept for backwards compatibility as this was the original way to do it in AG Grid.
|
|### 1. By Name
|
|When registering an Angular component by name you need to first register the component within the grid `frameworkComponents` property,
|then reference the component by name where you want it used (i.e. as a Cell Renderer, Filter etc).
|
|In this example we've registered our `CubeComponent` Angular Component and given it a name of `cubeComponent` (this can be any name you choose).
|We then specify that we want the previously registered `cubeComponent` to be used as a Cell Renderer in the `Cube` column:
|
|```tsx
|//...other imports
|import {Component} from '@angular/core';
|import CubeComponent from './CubeComponent';
|
|@Component({
|selector: 'app-root',
|template: `
|   <ag-grid-angular [frameworkComponents]="frameworkComponents" ...other properties>
|   </ag-grid-angular>
|`
|})
|export class AppComponent {
|   frameworkComponents: [
|       'cubeComponent': CubeComponent
|   ];          
|   columnDefs: [
|       {
|           headerName: "Cube",
|           field: "value",
|           cellRenderer: 'cubeComponent',     
|       }
|   ]
|
|   //...other properties & methods
|}
|```
|### 2. By Direct Reference
|
|When registering an Angular Component by reference you simply pass the Component to the place you want it used (i.e. Cell Renderer, Filter etc).
|
|In this example we're specifying that we want our `CubeComponent` Angular Component as a Cell Renderer in the `Cube` column:
|
|```tsx
|//...other imports
|import {Component} from '@angular/core';
|import CubeComponent from './CubeComponent';
|
|@Component({
|selector: 'app-root',
|template: `
|   <ag-grid-angular ...other properties>
|   </ag-grid-angular>
|`
|})
|export class AppComponent {
|   columnDefs: [
|       {
|           headerName: "Cube",
|           field: "value",
|           cellRendererFramework: CubeComponent,     
|       }
|   ]
|
|   //...other properties & methods
|}
|```
|When registering by Direct Reference you do not need to specify it in `frameworkComponents`, but you lose future flexibility 
|if you decide for example to switch this component out for another.
